# Codecademy + Hacker News

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It's widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In the Learn SQL from Scratch project, you will be working with a table named `hacker_news` that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

- 'Allez l'OM!'
- `title` - the title of the story
- `user` - the user who submitted the story
- `score` - the score of the story
- `timestamp` - the time of the story
- `url` - the link of the story

Thank you to Scott Bell at Hacker News for this dataset!
